## Package version control

This repository uses `renv` to ensure that a project-specific R package library is used and that functionality is maintained even if packages have breaking changes in the future.

If you are forking this package, make sure you create the same package library by using the command  `renv::restore()` to restore the project library locally to your machine.
You find more details on https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/collaborating.html.
